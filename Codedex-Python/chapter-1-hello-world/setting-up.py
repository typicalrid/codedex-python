# Welcome to the first chapter of The Legend of Python! 🐍

# The programming language we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s.



# Python is designed to be easy for us to read, which makes it the perfect coding language for beginners.

# It's also super versatile and used in the following areas:

# Data analysis & visualization
# Artificial intelligence (AI)
# Machine learning (ML)
# Web development
# And more!
# All the code we write in this course will be in Python files, with the .py extension. And we write them inside a code editor.

# A code editor is a text editor where we can write and execute code.

# There's a code editor on the right side, created just for you. 👉

# Let's give it a try!

# Instructions
# Copy and paste this line of code on line 3:

# print('Hi')

# Then press the "Run" button and wait 1-2 seconds.

# This should appear in the Terminal window if you did it correctly:

# Hi

# You are now ready for the journey ahead. (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ ✧

# Press the "Submit Answer" button and then "Next" to continue.

# Happy coding!

print('Hi')
